Motivation
==========

OpenSource scientific software is a fundamental building block of
scientific discovery, yet relies mostly on the effort of volunteers
scattered across the globe: this makes it hard to build communities, to
rapidly conduct complex discussions, and to focus on specific problems
long enough to find optimal solutions. We see sprints as one very
effective way of addressing these concerns, since bringing together
contributors strengthens social bonds and allows for much higher
bandwidth communications.

With the above in mind, we are organizing a series of sprints to improve
various libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem.
